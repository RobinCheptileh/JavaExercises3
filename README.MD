# JAVA EXERCISES

This is a set of four simple Java exercises. The project was created using Intellij IDEA and is organized in such a manner that it has a main file (Main.java) where it lists all questions and allows you to choose which you'd like to view the solution.
The questions are as follows:
1. Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements.
2. You are given a sequence of strings, each on a new line, until you receive “stop” command. First string is a name of a person. On the second line you receive his email. Your task is to collect their names and emails, and remove emails whose domain ends with "us" or "uk" (case insensitive).
3. By using the bubble sort algorithm, write a Java program to sort an integer array of 10 elements in ascending order.
4. Modify the Java code in exercise 3 to sort the array in descending order.
5. Write a Java program to solve quadratic equations.
